## CAEWeb

CAEWeb is a collection of web applications used by employees at a university's computer-aided engineering lab.  
The application makes it easy for the employees to update and organize inventories, work schedules, lab schedules, and other
important internal records.  The easiest way to figure out how the application works is playing around with the 
[demo app](https://loftythoughts.me/caeweb).  The demo app implements most of the original's functionalities but 
with a few alterations to eliminate features that depended on university-specific software.

CAEWeb uses [Laravel 4](https://laravel.com/docs/4.2) to serve several client-side [Backbone-marionette](http://marionettejs.com)
applications.  We used [Kendo UI](www.terlerik.com/kenod-ui) to build the room and employee schedulers.
